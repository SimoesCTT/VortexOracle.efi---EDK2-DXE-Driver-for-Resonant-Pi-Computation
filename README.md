# VortexOracle.efi---EDK2-DXE-Driver-for-Resonant-Pi-Computation
Overview VortexOracle.efi is a UEFI DXE (Driver Execution Environment) driver built for the EDK2 framework. It implements a hardware-oracle primitive that computes a resonant approximation of π using a specialized mathematical resonance identity at the 33rd layer of a temporal manifold.
